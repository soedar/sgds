description: With greater adoption of digital services over traditional physical delivery methods, there is an increasing need to ensure that they are of optimal quality. In this spirit, the <a href="https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg/">Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</a> aims to empower agencies to create fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly digital services with a common set of UI components, patterns, and templates.<br /><br />Where applicable, SGDS complies with the Digital Service Standards (DSS), which is a set of policies, standards, and guidelines to help agencies implement digital services that meet the goal of delivering digital services that are easy-to-use, seamless, and relevant, as set out in the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/">Digital Government Blueprint</a>.
